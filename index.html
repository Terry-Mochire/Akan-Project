     <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. On this site you can input your birthday and it will calculate the day of the week you were born and then depending on your gender tell you your Akan Name. </p>
